# Spinning up caprover locally

_Title_: Run Caprover in a linux vm on a mac mini! or any box you have lying around :)

_Language_: English

## The power of caprover

✅ CapRover can be used to run a private cloud

Install apps like Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, PhotoPrism, Calibre, etc.

You're essentially building a private alternative to Google Workspace, Dropbox, iCloud, etc.

💪 But CapRover is more than that:

⚙️ App hosting platform – run full-stack apps, APIs, websites

🚀 One-click apps – instant deployment of 100+ prebuilt apps

🔄 CI/CD-ready – deploy from GitHub, GitLab, or Docker builds

📦 Docker under the hood – advanced users can customize anything / standard users can deploy pre-built applications

🔧 Load balancing & scaling – baked in with Docker Swarm

Scared, sick or tired of paying those AWS bills? Ever pushed a full stack application to vercel? https://vercel.com/ and wondered: "Gee I hope I don't get pwn'd by bots?"

Why not self host? I don't mean localhost. I mean full blown:

```
 https://<my-app-name>.<my-custom-domain-name>.com
```

For this we can use Caprover.

CapRover is like having your own mini-Heroku or AWS, but completely free and self-hosted! It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that makes deploying and managing your applications super stupid simple.

There are two options for hosting caprover

🔵 1. In the cloud. 🔴 2. Locally.

Option 2 is a bit more complex but worth it if you have a mac mini, or spare box lying around. This tutorial will be done on a mac, however, much of it is still applicable.

Minimum specs:

🍪 <strong><u>CPU Architecture:</u></strong> CapRover source code is compatible with any CPU architecture and the Docker build available on Docker Hub is built for AMD64 (X86), ARM64, and ARMV7 CPUs.

🤖 <strong><u>Recommended Stack:</u></strong> CapRover is tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Docker 19.03. If you're using CapRover on a different OS, you might want to look at Docker Docs.

🐧 <strong><u>Ubuntu 24.04:</u></strong> This version has been tested by multiple people and there seems to be no known issues with this version.

🧠 <strong><u>Minimum RAM:</u></strong> Note that the build process sometimes consumes too much RAM, and 512MB RAM might not be enough (see this issue). Most providers offer a minimum of 1GB RAM on $5 instance including DigitalOcean, Vultr, Scaleway, Linode, SSD Nodes and etc.

## So I ask you

<div style={{ width: '260px', maxWidth: '100%' }}>
  <div style={{ height: 0, paddingBottom: '54.23%', position: 'relative' }}>

        left: 0,
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
      }}
