# Lets configure the repo side of the pipeline

## Introduction

Tired of manually deploying your code? Want to automate your deployment process? What does that mean? It means that you can push your code to a repository and have it run through a pipeline and automatically deployed to your server.

A few weekends ago I decided to attend the Tanda Hackathon, here in Brisbane. It was an excellent opportunity to network, showcase ideas while having a few beers with like-minded people.It is here that I met an AWS solutions architect that inspired me to build a deployment pipeline. He was excellent and helped me get some of the way.

The project we will deploy is a golang backend with a mongo database. The mongo database was chosen due to the anticipated need for fast read/writes at scale. You can of course use whatever you want :) this is just an example implementation with hopefully a few gotcha's along the way.

There are two main parts to the dance. 1. adding the necessary build files to your repo and 2. setting up the AWS side:

#### setting up the AWS side:

This part of the article will focus on the repository side.  Important files you will need to add to your project:  buildspec.yml - this can be appropriately named (I called mine buildspec_release.yml) appspec.yml - this taps into the lifecycle hooks of the pipeline and allows use to define scripts  a folder with the necessary scripts to run on each lifecycle event (more on this later)

Here is my buildspec.yml file. In here we can define how we would like our project to be built.  This was inspired by: https://github.com/dharnitski/golang-codebuild/blob/master/buildspec.yml
